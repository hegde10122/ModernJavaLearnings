# Java - Functional Programming

This course will teach you Modern Java features like Lambdas,Functional Interfaces, Streams API, Optionals, Functional Interfaces,Date/Time libraries and Parallel Programming. This is a purely coding based case-study project. Enjoy programming with Modern Java!!


Begin your learning journey of this case study project in this order below. I have mentioned every single Java package link here to assist your learning. Startin with point (1) below and till the end in that particular order mentioned for a smooth rude. Happy Learning!!

(1) Start with the lambda expressions first. In every package folder you will find learning.txt file
This file contains the gist of every concept distilled out for an easier grasp.

Click here Lambdas --> [learning.txt](https://github.com/hegde10122/ModernJavaLearnings/blob/master/hegde/src/java8/learnings/lambdas/learning.txt "Lambdas")

Then follow the code samples (Java files) mentioned in the learning.txt file. The code in the Java files have appropriate comments for easier understanding. Type the code in your text editor and compile it using a JDK on your machine. You can download this project itself and import into an IDE of your choice and follow the samples.
The code is free of cost and you can re-use it without giving me any credit. Enjoy the bliss !!

Now follow point (2) and the remaining as mentioned below.
