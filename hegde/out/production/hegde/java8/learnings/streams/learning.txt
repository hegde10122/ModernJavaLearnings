Streams API
------------------

Main purpose is to perform operations on collections.

Parallel operations are easy to perform with Streams API without having to create new threads.
We can use Streams API to perform operations on arrays and I/O.

What is a stream?
A) It is a sequence of elements which are created from collections such as a List,I/O resource or an Array.

Example:
------

List<String> fruits = Arrays.asList("orange","fig","apple","banana","muskmelon");
fruits.stream(); //creates a stream


Stream operations can be performed sequentially or in parallel.
Example:
------
fruits.parallelstream(); //creates a parallel stream
fruits.stream(); //creates a sequential stream
