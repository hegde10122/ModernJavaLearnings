Method references --- It is a nicer way to write functional interfaces.
We can refer a method in a class.

Syntax of Method Reference

1)
Class :: methodName

2)
Class :: static_methodName

3)
Instance (of the class) :: methodName

Method reference can be used when lambda refers to a method directly.

Example: We have the following Function functional interface.
Function<String,String> toLowerCase = (input) -> input.toLowerCase();

We can use method reference to shorten the syntax.
Function<String,String> toLowerCase = String::toLowerCase();
